If I am embarking on a journey to Switzerland and its neighboring countries, I will encounter 
situations where the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism come into play.


Inheritance :
    Inheritance involves inheriting data from a superclass to a subclass. While in Switzerland, 
    I initially decided to visit places like Geneva and the Rhine Falls. However, as I explored 
    further, I realized that I wanted to modify my travel plan. This led me to consider visiting
    neighboring countries as well. During this process, I revised my original list of places to 
    visit, creating a final itinerary. Additionally, I also added destinations like Interlaken 
    and Lucerne to the list. In this context, I am modifying my list, where the superclass 
    represents the initial list, and the subclass is the modified list.
Polymorphism : 
    Polymorphism, meaning "having many forms.When visiting different places, I often find myself 
    traveling from one location to another. To facilitate this journey, I have several 
    transportation options at my disposal, including cars, flights, and trains. While there 
    are many ways to travel, the ultimate goal remains the same: reaching my destination safely.
    In this context, there are various transportation methods, but the destination remains 
    constant here. There are many ways but the destination is same..
