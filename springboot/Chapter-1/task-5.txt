Reflect on Dependencies: Think about all the services and tools youâ€™d rely on during your Swiss journey,
from travel agencies to GPS apps. How do these dependencies relate to the Dependency Inversion Principle
in software design?

Reflecting on dependencies in Swiss journey and relating them to the Dependency Inversion Principle in software
design can be done like :

Dependency Inversion Principle :

    In this principle, both low-level and high-level dependencies rely on abstraction. 
    For example, if you need to travel to Switzerland for office work, and you have no prior 
    knowledge of the country or how to get there, you have two options: using GPS assistance or 
    seeking help from a friend who knows about Switzerland. When your manager asks you to go, this
    represents a high-level dependency. However, whether you choose to navigate using GPS or seek 
    your friend's guidance, these are lower-level dependencies.

    Both higher and lower dependencies are dependent on abstraction. The manager's request is 
    high-level because they only specify the need to go to Switzerland but don't dictate how you
    should get there. The decision to use GPS or your friend's help relies on abstracting the 
    travel details, allowing you to choose the specific approach that suits you best.
